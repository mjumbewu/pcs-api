This is an attempt at an API over HTTP for the PhillyCarShare reservation 
system.  It is built to run on Google App Engine, though there is very little
App Engine-specific code.  It should be easily adaptable to a Django install
(the view templates are in the Django template style).

The AppEngine/pcs directory is where most of the work happens.  It is arranged 
into four sub-directories:

 * data: The general data model for the API.  These are simple classes that 
   don'treally do anything aside from hold data.
   
 * input: This contains modules for input handlers.  The only input handlers
   being implemented right now (and probably ever to be implemented) are WSGI
   handlers.
   
 * source: This contains modules for communicating with the reservation system
   on PCS's servers.  The only sources implemented now are screenscraped, as
   PCS doesn't have a public API that I know of (hence this project).
   
 * view: This contains modules for representing the API data model.  One 
   possible view is HTML data, but there are definitely others in the pipeline
   (e.g., JSON).

Most of the code is well tested, and the tests are an important part of the 
package, especially since the only source for now is screenscraping.  The tests
reside in the AppEngine/test directory.
